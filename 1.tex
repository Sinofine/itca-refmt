\begin{document}
We shall begin by reviewing rapidly the definition and elementary properties of rings. This will indicate how much we are going to assume of the reader and it will also serve to fix notation and conventions. After this review we pass on to a discussion of prime and maximal ideals. The remainder of the chapter is devoted to explaining the various elementary operations which can be performed on ideals. The Grothendieck language of schemes is dealt with in the exercises at the end.

\section{RINGS AND RING HOMOMORPHISMS}
A ring $A$ is a set with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) such that

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $A$ is an abelian group with respect to addition (so that $A$ has a zero element, denoted by 0 , and every $x \in A$ has an (additive) inverse, $-x$ ).

  \item Multiplication is associative $((x y) z=x(y z))$ and distributive over addition $(x(y+z)=x y+x z,(y+z) x=y x+z x)$.

\end{enumerate}

We shall consider only rings which are commutative:

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item $x y=y x$ for all $x, y \in A$,
\end{enumerate}

and have an identity element (denoted by 1 ):

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \item $\exists 1 \in A$ such that $x 1=1 x=x$ for all $x \in A$.
\end{enumerate}

The identity element is then unique.

Throughout this book the word "ring" shall mean a commutative ring with an identity element, that is, a ring satisfying axioms (1) to (4) above.

Remark. We do not exclude the possibility in (4) that 1 might be equal to 0 . If so, then for any $x \in A$ we have

\[
x=x 1=x 0=0
\]

and so $A$ has only one element, 0 . In this case $A$ is the zero ring, denoted by 0 (by abuse of notation). A ring homomorphism is a mapping $f$ of a ring $A$ into a ring $B$ such that

i) $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ (so that $f$ is a homomorphism of abelian groups, and therefore also $f(x-y)=f(x)-f(y), f(-x)=-f(x), f(0)=0)$,

ii) $f(x y)=f(x) f(y)$,

iii) $f(1)=1$.

In other words, $f$ respects addition, multiplication and the identity element.

A subset $S$ of a ring $A$ is a subring of $A$ if $S$ is closed under addition and multiplication and contains the identity element of $A$. The identity mapping of $S$ into $A$ is then a ring homomorphism.

If $f: A \rightarrow B, g: B \rightarrow C$ are ring homomorphisms then so is their composition $g \circ f: A \rightarrow C$.

\section{IDEALS. QUOTIENT RINGS}
An ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of a ring $A$ is a subset of $A$ which is an additive subgroup and is such that $A \mathfrak{a} \subseteq \mathfrak{a}$ (i.e., $x \in A$ and $y \in \mathfrak{a}$ imply $x y \in \mathfrak{a}$ ). The quotient group $A / \mathfrak{a}$ inherits a uniquely defined multiplication from $A$ which makes it into a ring, called the quotient ring (or residue-class ring) $A / \mathfrak{a}$. The elements of $A / \mathfrak{a}$ are the cosets of $\mathfrak{a}$ in $A$, and the mapping $\phi: A \rightarrow A / \mathfrak{a}$ which maps each $x \in A$ to its coset $x+a$ is a surjective ring homomorphism.

We shall frequently use the following fact:

Proposition 1.1. There is a one-to-one order-preserving. correspondence between the ideals $\mathfrak{b}$ of $A$ which contain $\mathfrak{a}$, and the ideals $\bar{b}$ of $A / \mathfrak{a}$, given by $\mathfrak{b}=\phi^{-1}(\bar{b})$.

If $f: A \rightarrow B$ is any ring homomorphism, the kernel of $f\left(=f^{-1}(0)\right)$ is an ideal a of $A$, and the image of $f(=f(A))$ is a subring $C$ of $B$; and $f$ induces a ring isomorphism $A / \mathfrak{a} \cong C$.

We shall sometimes use the notation $x \equiv y(\bmod a)$; this means that $x-y \in \mathfrak{a}$.

\section{ZERO-DIVISORS. NILPOTENT ELEMENTS. UNITS}
A zero-divisor in a ring $A$ is an element $x$ which "divides 0 ", i.e., for which there exists $y \neq 0$ in $A$ such that $x y=0$. A ring with no zero-divisors $\neq 0$ (and in which $1 \neq 0$ ) is called an integral domain. For example, $\mathbf{Z}$ and $k\left[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right]$ ( $k$ a field, $x_{i}$ indeterminates) are integral domains.

An element $x \in A$ is nilpotent if $x^{n}=0$ for some $n>0$. A nilpotent element is a zero-divisor (unless $A=0$ ), but not conversely (in general).

A unit in $A$ is an element $x$ which "divides 1 ", i.e., an element $x$ such that $x y=1$ for some $y \in A$. The element $y$ is then uniquely determined by $x$, and is written $x^{-1}$. The units in $A$ form a (multiplicative) abelian group. The multiples $a x$ of an element $x \in A$ form a principal ideal, denoted by $(x)$ or $A x$. $x$ is a unit $\Leftrightarrow(x)=A=(1)$. The zero ideal (0) is usually denoted by 0 .

A field is a ring $A$ in which $1 \neq 0$ and every non-zero element is a unit. Every field is an integral domain (but not conversely: $\mathbf{Z}$ is not a field).

Proposition 1.2. Let $A$ be a ring $\neq 0$. Then the following are equivalent:

i) $A$ is a field;

ii) the only ideals in $A$ are 0 and (1);

iii) every homomorphism of $A$ into a non-zero ring $B$ is injective.

Proof. i) $\Rightarrow$ ii). Let $\mathfrak{a} \neq 0$ be an ideal in $A$. Then $a$ contains a non-zero element $x ; x$ is a unit, hence $\mathfrak{a} \supseteq(x)=(1)$, hence $\mathfrak{a}=(1)$.

ii) $\Rightarrow$ iii). Let $\phi: A \rightarrow B$. be a ring homomorphism. Then $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$ is an ideal $\neq(1)$ in $A$, hence $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)=0$, hence $\phi$ is injective.

iii) $\Rightarrow$ i). Let $x$ be an element of $A$ which is not a unit. Then $(x) \neq(1)$, hence $B=A /(x)$ is not the zero ring. Let $\phi: A \rightarrow B$ be the natural homomorphism of $A$ onto $B$, with kernel $(x)$. By hypothesis, $\phi$ is injective, hence $(x)=0$, hence $x=0$.

\section{PRIME IDEALS AND MAXIMAL IDEALS}
An ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ in $A$ is prime if $\mathfrak{p} \neq(1)$ and if $x y \in \mathfrak{p} \Rightarrow x \in \mathfrak{p}$ or $y \in \mathfrak{p}$.

An ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ in $A$ is maximal if $\mathfrak{m} \neq(1)$ and if there is no ideal $a$ such that $\mathfrak{m} \subset \mathfrak{a} \subset$ (1) (strict inclusions). Equivalently:

$\mathfrak{p}$ is prime $\Leftrightarrow A / \mathfrak{p}$ is an integral domain;

$\mathfrak{m}$ is maximal $\Leftrightarrow A / \mathfrak{m}$ is a field (by (1.1) and (1.2)).

Hence a maximai ideal is prime (but not converseiy, in general). The zero ideal is prime $\Leftrightarrow A$ is an integral domain.

If $f: A \rightarrow B$ is a ring homomorphism and $q$ is a prime ideal in $B$, then $f^{-1}(q)$ is a prime ideal in $A$, for $A / f^{-1}(q)$ is isomorphic to a subring of $B / q$ and hence has no zero-divisor $\neq 0$. But if $\mathfrak{n}$ is a maximal ideal of $B$ it is not necessarily true that $f^{-1}(\mathfrak{n})$ is maximal in $A$; all we can say for sure is that it is prime. (Example: $A=\mathrm{Z}, B=\mathbf{Q}, \mathfrak{n}=0$.)

Prime ideals are fundamental to the whole of commutative algebra. The following theorem and its corollaries ensure that there is always a sufficient supply of them.

Theorem 1.3. Every ring $A \neq 0$ has at least one maximal ideal. (Remember that "ring" means commutative ring with 1.)

Proof. This is a standard application of Zorn's lemma.* Let $\Sigma$ be the set of all ideals $\neq(1)$ in $A$. Order $\Sigma$ by inclusion. $\Sigma$ is not empty, since $0 \in \Sigma$. To apply

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $S$ be a non-empty partially ordered set (i.e., we are given a relation $x \leqslant y$ on $S$ which is reflexive and transitive and such that $x \leqslant y$ and $y \leqslant x$ together imply Zorn's lemma we must show that every chain in $\Sigma$ has an upper bound in $\Sigma$; let then $\left(\mathfrak{a}_{\alpha}\right)$ be a chain of ideals in $\Sigma$, so that for each pair of indices $\alpha, \beta$ we have either $\mathfrak{a}_{\alpha} \subseteq \mathfrak{a}_{\beta}$ or $\mathfrak{a}_{\beta} \subseteq \mathfrak{a}_{\alpha}$. Let $\mathfrak{a}=\bigcup_{\alpha} \mathfrak{a}_{\alpha}$. Then $\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal (verify this) and $1 \notin \mathfrak{a}$ because $1 \notin \mathfrak{a}_{\alpha}$ for all $\alpha$. Hence $a \in \Sigma$, and $a$ is an upper bound of the chain. Hence by Zorn's lemma $\Sigma$ has a maximal element.
\end{itemize}

Corollary 1.4. If $a \neq(1)$ is an ideal of $A$, there exists a maximal ideal of $A$ containing a.

Proof. Apply (1.3) to $A / \mathfrak{a}$, bearing in mind (1.1). Alternatively, modify the proof of (1.3).

Corollary 1.5. Every non-unit of $A$ is contained in a maximal ideal.

Remarks. 1) If $A$ is Noetherian (Chapter 7) we can avoid the use of Zorn's lemma: the set of all ideals $\neq(1)$ has a maximal element.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item There exist rings with exactly one maximal ideal, for example fields. A ring $A$ with exactly one maximal ideal $m$ is called a local ring. The field $k=A / \mathfrak{m}$ is called the residue field of $A$.
\end{enumerate}

Proposition 1.6. i) Let $A$ be a ring and $\mathfrak{m} \neq(1)$ an ideal of $A$ such that every $x \in A-\mathfrak{m}$ is a unit in $A$. Then $A$ is a local ring and $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal.

ii) Let $A$ be a ring and $m$ a maximal ideal of $A$, such that every element of $1+\mathfrak{m}$ (i.e., every $1+x$, where $x \in \mathfrak{m})$ is a unit in $A$. Then $A$ is a local ring. Proof. i) Every ideal $\neq(1)$ consists of non-units, hence is contained in $\mathfrak{m}$. Hence $\mathfrak{m}$ is the only maximal ideal of $A$.

ii) Let $x \in A-\mathfrak{m}$. Since $\mathfrak{m}$ is maximal, the ideal generated by $x$ and $\mathfrak{m}$ is (1), hence there exist $y \in A$ and $t \in \mathfrak{m}$ such that $x y+t=1$; hence $x y=1-t$ belongs to $1+\mathfrak{m}$ and therefore is a unit. Now use $i$ ).

A ring with only a finite number of maximal ideals is called semi-local.

Examples. 1) $A=k\left[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right], k$ a field. Let $f \in A$ be an irreducible polynomial. By unique factorization, the ideal $(f)$ is prime.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item $A=Z$. Every ideal in $Z$ is of the form $(m)$ for some $m \geqslant 0$. The ideal $(m)$ is prime $\Leftrightarrow m=0$ or a prime number. All the ideals $(p)$, where $p$ is a prime number, are maximal: $Z /(p)$ is the field of $p$ elements.
\end{enumerate}

The same holds in Example 1) for $n=1$, but not for $n>1$. The ideal $n$ of all polynomials in $A=k\left[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right]$ with zero constant term is maximal (since

$x=y$ ). A subset $T$ of $S$ is a chain if either $x \leqslant y$ or $y \leqslant x$ for every pair of elements $x, y$ in $T$. Then Zorn's lemma may be stated as follows: if every chain $T$ of $S$ has an upper bound in $S$ (i.e., if there exists $x \in S$ such that $t \leqslant x$ for all $t \in T$ ) then $S$ has at least one maximal element.

For a proof of the equivalence of Zorn's lemma with the axiom of choice, the well-ordering principle, etc., see for example P. R. Halmos, Naive Set Theory, Van Nostrand (1960). it is the kernel of the homomorphism $A \rightarrow k$ which maps $f \in A$ to $f(0)$ ). But if $n>1, \mathfrak{m}$ is not a principal ideal: in fact it requires at least $n$ generators.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item A principal ideal domain is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal. In such a ring every non-zero prime ideal is maximal. For if $(x) \neq 0$ is a prime ideal and $(y) \supset(x)$, we have $x \in(y)$, say $x=y z$, so that $y z \in(x)$ and $y \notin(x)$, hence $z \in(x)$ : say $z=t x$. Then $x=y z=y t x$, so that $y t=1$ and therefore $(y)=(1)$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{NILRADICAL AND JACOBSON RADICAL}
Proposition 1.7. The set $\mathfrak{R}$ of all nilpotent elements in a ring $A$ is an ideal, and $A / \Re$ has no nilpotent element $\neq 0$.

Proof. If $x \in \mathfrak{N}$, clearly $a x \in \mathfrak{R}$ for all $a \in A$. Let $x, y \in \mathfrak{N}$ : say $x^{m}=0, y^{n}=0$. By the binomial theorem (which is valid in any commutative ring), $(x+y)^{m+n-1}$ is a sum of integer multiples of products $x^{r} y^{3}$, where $r+s=m+n-1$; we cannot have both $r<m$ and $s<n$, hence each of these products vanishes and therefore $(x+y)^{m+n-1}=0$. Hence $x+y \in \mathfrak{R}$ and therefore $\mathfrak{R}$ is an ideal.

Let $\bar{x} \in A / \mathfrak{N}$ be represented by $x \in A$. Then $\bar{x}^{n}$ is represented by $x^{n}$, so that $\bar{x}^{n}=0 \Rightarrow x^{n} \in \mathfrak{N} \Rightarrow\left(x^{n}\right)^{k}=0$ for some $k>0 \Rightarrow x \in \mathfrak{N} \Rightarrow \bar{x}=0$.

The ideal $\mathfrak{R}$ is called the nilradical of $A$. The following proposition gives an alternative definition of $\mathfrak{R}$ :

Proposition 1.8. The nilradical of $A$ is the intersection of all the prime ideals of $A$.

Proof. Let $\mathfrak{R}^{\prime}$ denote the intersection of all the prime ideals of $A$. If $f \in A$ is nilpotent and if $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal, then $f^{n}=0 \in \mathfrak{p}$ for some $n>0$, hence $f \in \mathfrak{p}$ (because $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime). Hence $f \in \mathfrak{N}^{\prime}$.

Conversely, suppose that $f$ is not nilpotent. Let $\Sigma$ be the set of ideals $a$ with the property

\[
n>0 \Rightarrow f^{n} \notin \mathfrak{a} .
\]

Then $\Sigma$ is not empty because $0 \in \Sigma$. As in (1.3) Zorn's lemma can be applied to the set $\Sigma$, ordered by inclusion, and therefore $\Sigma$ has a maximal element. Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a maximal element of $\Sigma$. We shall show that $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal. Let $x, y \notin \mathfrak{p}$. Then the ideals $\mathfrak{p}+(x), \mathfrak{p}+(y)$ strictly contain $\mathfrak{p}$ and therefore do not belong to $\Sigma$; hence

\[
f^{m} \in \mathfrak{p}+(x), \quad f^{n} \in \mathfrak{p}+(y)
\]

for some $m, n$. It follows that $f^{m+n} \in \mathfrak{p}+(x y)$, hence the ideal $\mathfrak{p}+(x y)$ is not in $\Sigma$ and therefore $x y \notin \mathfrak{p}$. Hence we have a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ such that $f \notin \mathfrak{p}$, so that $f \notin \mathfrak{\mathfrak { R } ^ { \prime }}$.

The Jacobson radical $\Re$ of $A$ is defined to be the intersection of all the maximal ideals of $A$. It can be characterized as follows: Proposition 1.9. $x \in \Re \Leftrightarrow 1-x y$ is a unit in $A$ for all $y \in A$. Proof. $\Rightarrow$ : Suppose $1-x y$ is not a unit. By (1.5) it belongs to some maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$; but $x \in \mathfrak{R} \subseteq \mathfrak{m}$, hence $x y \in \mathfrak{m}$ and therefore $1 \in \mathfrak{m}$, which is absurd.

$\nLeftarrow$ : Suppose $x \notin \mathfrak{m}$ for some maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$. Then $\mathfrak{m}$ and $x$ generate the unit ideal (1), so that we have $u+x y=1$ for some $u \in \mathfrak{m}$ and some $y \in A$. Hence $1-x y \in \mathfrak{m}$ and is therefore not a unit.

\section{OPERATIONS ON IDEALS}
If $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}$ are ideals in a ring $A$, their sum $\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}$ is the set of all $x+y$ where $x \in \mathfrak{a}$ and $y \in \mathfrak{b}$. It is the smallest ideal containing $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$. More generally, we may define the sum $\sum_{\mathfrak{i} \in I} a_{\mathfrak{i}}$ of any family (possibly infinite) of ideals $a_{\mathfrak{i}}$ of $A$; its elements are all sums $\sum x_{i}$, where $x_{i} \in a_{i}$ for all $i \in I$ and almost all of the $x_{i}$ (i.e., all but a finite set) are zero. It is the smallest ideal of $A$ which contains all the ideals $a_{i}$.

The intersection of any family $\left(\mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{i}}\right)_{\mathfrak{t} \in I}$ of ideals is an ideal. Thus the ideals of $A$ form a complete lattice with respect to inclusion.

The product of two ideals $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}$ in $A$ is the ideal $\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b}$ generated by all products $x y$, where $x \in \mathfrak{a}$ and $y \in \mathfrak{b}$. It is the set of all finite sums $\sum x_{\mathfrak{i}} y_{\mathfrak{i}}$ where each $x_{\mathfrak{i}} \in \mathfrak{a}$ and each $y_{\mathfrak{t}} \in \mathfrak{b}$. Similarly we define the product of any finite family of ideals. In particular the powers $a^{n}(n>0)$ of an ideal a are defined; conventionally, $\mathfrak{a}^{0}=(1)$. Thus $\mathfrak{a}^{n}(n>0)$ is the ideal generated by all products $x_{1} x_{2} \cdots x_{n}$ in which each factor $x_{i}$ belongs to $a$.

Examples. 1) If $A=\mathbf{Z}, \mathfrak{a}=(m), \mathfrak{b}=(n)$ then $\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}$ is the ideal generated by the h.c.f. of $m$ and $n ; \mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}$ is the ideal generated by their l.c.m.; and $\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b}=(m n)$. Thus (in this case) $\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b}=\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b} \Leftrightarrow m, n$ are coprime.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item $A=k\left[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right], a=\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)=$ ideal generated by $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}$. Then $a^{m}$ is the set of all polynomials with no terms of degree $<m$.
\end{enumerate}

The three operations so far defined (sum, intersection, product) are all commutative and associative. Also there is the distributive law

\[
\mathfrak{a}(\mathfrak{b}+\mathfrak{c})=\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b}+\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{c} .
\]

In the ring $Z, \cap$ and + are distributive over each other. This is not the case in general, and the best we have in this direction is the modular law

\[
\mathfrak{a} \cap(\mathfrak{b}+\mathfrak{c})=\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}+\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{c} \text { if } \mathfrak{a} \geq \mathfrak{b} \text { or } \mathfrak{a} \supseteq \mathfrak{c} .
\]

Again, in $\mathbf{Z}$, we have $(\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b})(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})=\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b}$; but in general we have only $(\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b})(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}) \subseteq \mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b} \quad($ since $\quad(\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b})(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})=\mathfrak{a}(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})+\mathfrak{b}(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}) \subseteq \mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b})$ Clearly $\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b} \subseteq \mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}$, hence

\[
\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}=\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b} \text { provided } \mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}=(1) .
\]

Two ideals $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}$ are said to be coprime (or comaximal) if $\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}=(1)$. Thus for coprime ideals we have $\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}=\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b}$. Clearly two ideals $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}$ are coprime if and only if there exist $x \in \mathfrak{a}$ and $y \in \mathfrak{b}$ such that $x+y=1$.

Let $A_{i}, \ldots, A_{n}$ be rings. Their direct product

\[
A=\prod_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}
\]

is the set of all sequences $x=\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$ with $x_{i} \in A_{i}(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n)$ and componentwise addition and multiplication. $A$ is a commutative ring with identity element $(1,1, \ldots, 1)$. We have projections $p_{i}: A \rightarrow A_{i}$ defined by $p_{i}(x)=x_{i}$; they are ring homomorphisms.

Let $A$ be a ring and $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}$ ideals of $A$. Define a homomorphism

\[
\phi: A \rightarrow \prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(A / \mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{i}}\right)
\]

by the rule $\phi(x)=\left(x+a_{1}, \ldots, x+a_{n}\right)$.

Proposition 1.10. i) If $\mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{l}}, \mathfrak{a}_{j}$ are coprime whenever $i \neq j$, then $\Pi a_{i}=\bigcap a_{\mathfrak{i}}$.

ii) $\phi$ is surjective $\Leftrightarrow \mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{l}}, \mathfrak{a}_{j}$ are coprime whenever $i \neq j$.

iii) $\phi$ is injective $\Leftrightarrow \cap a_{\mathfrak{i}}=(0)$.

Proof. i) by induction on $n$. The case $n=2$ is dealt with above. Suppose $n>2$ and the result true for $\mathfrak{a}_{1}, \ldots, a_{n-1}$, and let $\mathfrak{b}=\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} \mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{i}}=\bigcap_{\mathfrak{i}=1}^{n-1} \mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{l}}$. Since $a_{i}+a_{n}=(1)(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n-1)$ we have equations $x_{i}+y_{i}=1\left(x_{i} \in a_{i}, y_{i} \in a_{n}\right)$ and therefore

\[
\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} x_{i}=\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}\left(1-y_{i}\right) \equiv 1\left(\bmod a_{n}\right) .
\]

Hence $\mathfrak{a}_{n}+\mathfrak{b}=(1)$ and so

\[
\prod_{\mathfrak{i}=\frac{1}{1}}^{n} \mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{i}}=\mathfrak{b} \mathfrak{a}_{n}=\mathfrak{b} \cap \mathfrak{a}_{n}=\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} \mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{l}} .
\]

ii) $\Rightarrow$ : Let us show for example that $\mathfrak{a}_{1}, \mathfrak{a}_{2}$ are coprime. There exists $x \in A$ such that $\phi(x)=(1,0, \ldots, 0)$; hence $x \equiv 1\left(\bmod a_{1}\right)$ and $x \equiv 0\left(\bmod a_{2}\right)$, so that

\[
1=(1-x)+x \in \mathfrak{a}_{1}+\mathfrak{a}_{2} .
\]

$\Leftrightarrow:$ It is enough to show, for example, that there is an element $x \in A$ such that $\phi(x)=(1,0, \ldots, 0)$. Since $a_{1}+a_{i}=(1)(i>1)$ we have equations $u_{i}+v_{i}=1$ $\left(u_{i} \in a_{1}, v_{i} \in a_{i}\right)$. Take $x=\prod_{i=2}^{n} v_{i}$, then $x=\Pi\left(1-u_{i}\right) \equiv 1\left(\bmod a_{1}\right)$, and $x \equiv 0\left(\bmod a_{i}\right), i>1$. Hence $\phi(x)=(1,0, \ldots, 0)$ as required.

iii) Clear, since $\cap a_{\mathfrak{l}}$ is the kernel of $\phi$.

The union $\mathfrak{a} \cup \mathfrak{b}$ of ideals is not in general an ideal. Proposition 1.11. i) Let $\mathfrak{p}_{1}, \ldots, \mathfrak{p}_{n}$ be prime ideals and let $\mathfrak{a}$ be an ideal contained in $\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \mathfrak{p}_{i}$. Then $\mathfrak{a} \subseteq \mathfrak{p}_{i}$ for some $i$.

ii) Let $\mathfrak{a}_{1}, \ldots, \mathfrak{a}_{n}$ be ideals and let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal containing $\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} \mathfrak{a}_{i}$. Then $\mathfrak{p} \supseteq \mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{i}}$ for some $i$. If $\mathfrak{p}=\bigcap \mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{i}}$, then $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{i}}$ for some $i$.

Proof. i) is proved by induction on $n$ in the form

\[
\mathfrak{a} \notin \mathfrak{p}_{i}(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n) \Rightarrow \mathfrak{a} \notin \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \mathcal{H}_{i} .
\]

It is certainly true for $n=1$. If $n>1$ and the result is true for $n-1$, then for each $i$ there exists $x_{i} \in \mathfrak{a}$ such that $x_{i} \notin \mathfrak{p}_{j}$ whenever $j \neq i$. If for some $i$ we have' $x_{i} \notin \mathfrak{p}_{i}$, we are through. If not, then $x_{i} \in \mathfrak{p}_{i}$ for all $i$. Consider the element

\[
y=\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{1} x_{2} \cdots x_{i-1} x_{i+1} x_{i+2} \cdots x_{n}
\]

we have $y \in a$ and $y \notin \mathfrak{p}_{i}(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n)$. Hence $a \neq \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \mathfrak{p}_{i}$.

ii) Suppose $p \neq \boldsymbol{a}_{i}$ for all $i$. Then there exist $x_{i} \in \mathfrak{a}_{i}, x_{i} \notin \mathfrak{p}(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n)$, and therefore $\Pi x_{\mathfrak{i}} \in \Pi \mathfrak{a}_{i} \subseteq \bigcap \mathfrak{a}_{i}$; but $\Pi x_{\mathfrak{i}} \notin \mathfrak{p}$ (since $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime). Hence $\mathfrak{p} \notin \cap \mathfrak{a}_{i}$. Finally, if $\mathfrak{p}=\bigcap \mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{t}}$, then $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq \mathfrak{a}_{\dot{j}}$ and hence $\mathfrak{y}=\mathfrak{a}_{i}$ for some $i$.

If $\symfrak{a}, \symfrak{b}$ are ideals in a ring $A$, their \textit{ideal quotient} is
\[
(\mathfrak{a}: \mathfrak{b})=\{x \in A: x \mathfrak{b} \subseteq \mathfrak{a}\}
\]

which is an ideal. In particular, $(0: \mathfrak{b})$ is called the annihilator of $\mathfrak{b}$ and is also denoted by Ann (b): it is the set of all $x \in A$ such that $x \mathfrak{b}=0$. In this notation the set of all zero-divisors in $A$ is

\[
D=\bigcup_{x \neq 0} \operatorname{Ann}(x) \text {. }
\]

If $\mathfrak{b}$ is a principal ideal $(x)$, we shall write $(\mathfrak{a}: x)$ in place of $(\mathfrak{a}:(x))$.

Example. If $A=\mathbf{Z}, \mathfrak{a}=(m), \mathfrak{b}=(n)$, where say $m=\prod_{p} p^{\mu_{p}}, n=\Pi_{p} p^{v_{p}}$, then $(\mathfrak{a}: \mathfrak{b})=(q)$ where $q=\prod_{p} p^{\gamma_{p}}$ and

\[
\gamma_{p}=\max \left(\mu_{p}-\nu_{p}, 0\right)=\mu_{p}-\min \left(\mu_{p}, \nu_{p}\right) .
\]

Hence $q=m /(m, n)$, where $(m, n)$ is the h.c.f. of $m$ and $n$.

Exercise 1.12. i) $a \subseteq(a: b)$

ii) $(\mathfrak{a}: \mathfrak{b}) \mathfrak{b} \subseteq \mathfrak{a}$

iii) $((\mathfrak{a}: \mathfrak{b}): \mathfrak{c})=(\mathfrak{a}: \mathfrak{b c})=((\mathfrak{a}: \mathfrak{c}): \mathfrak{b})$

iv) $\left(\bigcap_{i} \mathfrak{a}_{i}: \mathfrak{b}\right)=\bigcap_{\mathfrak{i}}\left(\mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{i}}: \mathfrak{b}\right)$

v) $\left(\mathfrak{a}: \sum_{i} \mathfrak{b}_{\mathfrak{i}}\right)=\bigcap_{i}\left(\mathfrak{a}: \mathfrak{b}_{\mathfrak{i}}\right)$.

If $\mathfrak{a}$ is any ideal of $A$, the radical of $\mathfrak{a}$ is

\[
r(\mathfrak{a})=\left\{x \in A: x^{n} \in \mathfrak{a} \text { for some } n>0\right\} .
\]

If $\phi: A \rightarrow A / \mathfrak{a}$ is the standard homomorphism, then $r(\mathfrak{a})=\phi^{-1}\left(\mathfrak{\cap}_{A / \mathfrak{a}}\right)$ and hence $r(\mathfrak{a})$ is an ideal by (1.7). Exercise 1.13. i) $r(\mathfrak{a}) \supseteq \mathfrak{a}$

ii) $r(r(\mathfrak{a}))=r(\mathfrak{a})$

iii) $r(\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b})=r(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})=r(\mathfrak{a}) \cap r(\mathfrak{b})$

iv) $r(a)=(1) \Leftrightarrow \mathfrak{a}=(1)$

v) $r(\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b})=r(r(\mathfrak{a})+r(\mathfrak{b}))$

vi) if $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime, $r\left(\mathfrak{p}^{n}\right)=\mathfrak{p}$ for all $n>0$.

Proposition 1.14. The radical of an ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ is the intersection of the prime ideals which contain $\mathfrak{a}$.

Proof. Apply (1.8) to $A / \mathfrak{a}$.

More generally, we may define the radical $r(E)$ of any subset $E$ of $A$ in the same way. It is not an ideal in general. We have $r\left(\bigcup_{\alpha} E_{\alpha}\right)=\bigcup r\left(E_{\alpha}\right)$, for any family of subsets $E_{\alpha}$ of $A$.

Proposition 1.15. $D=$ set of zero-divisors of $A=\bigcup_{x \neq 0} r(\operatorname{Ann}(x))$.

Proof. $D=r(D)=r\left(\bigcup_{x \neq 0}\right.$ Ann $\left.(x)\right)=\bigcup_{x \neq 0} r($ Ann $(x))$.

Example. If $A=\mathbf{Z}, \mathfrak{a}=(m)$, let $p_{\mathfrak{i}}(1 \leqslant i \leqslant r)$ be the distinct prime divisors of $m$. Then $r(\mathfrak{a})=\left(p_{1} \cdots p_{r}\right)=\bigcap_{i=1}^{r}\left(p_{i}\right)$.

Proposition 1.16. Let $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}$ be ideals in a ring $A$ such that $r(\mathfrak{a}), r(\mathfrak{b})$ are coprime. Then $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}$ are coprime.

Proof. $r(\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b})=r(r(\mathfrak{a})+r(\mathfrak{b}))=r(1)=(1)$, hence $\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}=(1)$ by (1.13).

\section{EXTENSION AND CONTRACTION}
Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be a ring homomorphism. If $\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal in $A$, the set $f(\mathfrak{a})$ is not necessarily an ideal in $B$ (e.g., let $f$ be the embedding of $\mathbf{Z}$ in $\mathbf{Q}$, the field of rationals, and take $a$ to be any non-zero ideal in $Z$.) We define the extension $\mathfrak{a}^{e}$ of $\mathfrak{a}$ to be the ideal $B f(\mathfrak{a})$ generated by $f(\mathfrak{a})$ in $B$ : explicitly, $\mathfrak{a}^{e}$ is the set of all sums $\sum y_{i} f\left(x_{i}\right)$ where $x_{i} \in \mathfrak{a}, y_{i} \in B$.

If $\mathfrak{b}$ is an ideal of $B$, then $f^{-1}(\mathfrak{b})$ is always an ideal of $A$, called the contraction $\mathfrak{b}^{c}$ of $\mathfrak{b}$. If $\mathfrak{b}$ is prime, then $\mathfrak{b}^{c}$ is prime. If $\mathfrak{a}$ is prime, $\mathfrak{a}^{e}$ need not be prime (for example, $f: \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Q}, \mathfrak{a} \neq 0$; then $\mathfrak{a}^{e}=\mathbf{Q}$, which is not a prime ideal).

We can factorize $f$ as follows:

\[
A \stackrel{p}{\rightarrow} f(A) \stackrel{j}{\rightarrow} B
\]

where $p$ is surjective and $j$ is injective. For $p$ the situation is very simple (1.1): there is a one-to-one correspondence between ideals of $f(A)$ and ideals of $A$ which contain $\operatorname{Ker}(f)$, and prime ideals correspond to prime ideals. For $j$, on the other hand, the general situation is very complicated. The classical example is from algebraic number theory. Example. Consider $\mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}[i]$, where $i=\sqrt{-1}$. A prime ideal $(p)$ of $\mathbf{Z}$ may or may not stay prime when extended to $Z[i]$. In fact $Z[i]$ is a principal ideal domain (because it has a Euclidean algorithm) and the situation is as follows:

i) $(2)^{e}=\left((1+i)^{2}\right)$, the square of a prime ideal in $Z[i]$;

ii) If $p \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$ then $(p)^{e}$ is the product of two distinct prime ideals (for example, $\left.(5)^{e}=(2+i)(2-i)\right)$;

iii) If $p \equiv 3(\bmod 4)$ then $(p)^{e}$ is prime in $Z[i]$.

Of these, ii) is not a trivial result. It is effectively equivalent to a theorem of Fermat which says that a prime $p \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$ can be expressed, essentially uniquely, as a sum of two integer squares (thus $5=2^{2}+1^{2}, 97=9^{2}+4^{2}$, etc.).

In fact the behavior of prime ideals under extensions of this sort is one of the central problems of algebraic number theory.

Let $f: A \rightarrow B$, $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ be as before. Then

Proposition 1.17. i) $\mathfrak{a} \subseteq \mathfrak{a}^{e c}, \mathfrak{b} \supseteq \mathfrak{b}^{c e}$;

ii) $\mathfrak{b}^{c}=\mathfrak{b}^{\text {cec }}, \mathfrak{a}^{e}=\mathfrak{a}^{e c e}$;

iii) If $C$ is the set of contracted ideals in $A$ and if $E$ is the set of extended ideals in $B$, then $C=\left\{\mathfrak{a} \mid \mathfrak{a}^{e c}=\mathfrak{a}\right\}, E=\left\{\mathfrak{b} \mid \mathfrak{b}^{c e}=\mathfrak{b}\right\}$, and $\mathfrak{a} \mapsto \mathfrak{a}^{e}$ is a bijective map of $C$ onto $E$, whose inverse is $\mathfrak{b} \mapsto \mathfrak{b}^{c}$.

Proof. i) is trivial, and ii) follows from i).

iii) If $\mathfrak{a} \in C$, then $\mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{b}^{c} .=\mathfrak{b}^{\text {cec }}=\mathfrak{a}^{e c}$; conversely if $\mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{a}^{e c}$ then $\mathfrak{a}$ is the contraction of $\mathfrak{a}^{e}$. Similarly for $E$.

Exercise 1.18. If $\mathfrak{a}_{1}, a_{2}$ are ideals of $A$ and if $\mathfrak{b}_{1}, \mathfrak{b}_{2}$ are ideals of $B$, then

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\left(\mathfrak{a}_{1}+\mathfrak{a}_{2}\right)^{e}=\mathfrak{a}_{1}^{e}+\mathfrak{a}_{2}^{e}, & \left(\mathfrak{b}_{1}+\mathfrak{b}_{2}\right)^{c} \supseteq \mathfrak{b}_{1}^{c}+\mathfrak{b}_{2}^{c}, \\
\left(a_{1} \cap \mathfrak{a}_{2}\right)^{e} \subseteq \mathfrak{a}_{1}^{e} \cap \mathfrak{a}_{2}^{e}, & \left(\mathfrak{b}_{1} \cap \mathfrak{b}_{2}\right)^{c}=\mathfrak{b}_{1}^{c} \cap \mathfrak{b}_{2}^{c}, \\
\left(\mathfrak{a}_{1} \mathfrak{a}_{2}\right)^{e}=\mathfrak{a}_{1}^{e} \mathfrak{a}_{2}^{e}, & \left(\mathfrak{b}_{1} \mathfrak{b}_{2}\right)^{c} \supseteq \mathfrak{b}_{1}^{c} \mathfrak{b}_{2}^{c}, \\
\left(\mathfrak{a}_{1}: \mathfrak{a}_{2}\right)^{e} \subseteq\left(\mathfrak{a}_{1}^{e}: \mathfrak{a}_{2}^{e}\right), & \left(\mathfrak{b}_{1}: \mathfrak{b}_{2}\right)^{c} \subseteq\left(\mathfrak{b}_{1}^{c}: \mathfrak{b}_{2}^{c}\right), \\
r(\mathfrak{a})^{e} \subseteq r\left(\mathfrak{a}^{e}\right), & r(\mathfrak{b})^{c}=r\left(\mathfrak{b}^{c}\right) .
\end{array}
\]

The set of ideals $E$ is closed under sum and product, and $C$ is closed under the other three operations.

\section{EXERCISES}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $x$ be a nilpotent element of a ring $A$. Show that $1+x$ is a unit of $A$. Deduce that the sum of a nilpotent element and a unit is a unit.

  \item Let $A$ be a ring and let $A[x]$ be the ring of polynomials in an indeterminate $x$, with coefficients in $A$. Let $f=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n} \in A[x]$. Prove that i) $f$ is a unit in $A[x] \Leftrightarrow a_{0}$ is a unit in $A$ and $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nilpotent. [If $b_{0}+b_{1} x+\cdots+b_{m} x^{m}$ is the inverse of $f$, prove by induction on $r$ that $a_{n}^{r+1} b_{m-r}=0$. Hence show that $a_{n}$ is nilpotent, and then use Ex. 1.]

\end{enumerate}

ii) $f$ is nilpotent $\Leftrightarrow a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nilpotent.

iii) $f$ is a zero-divisor $\Leftrightarrow$ there exists $a \neq 0$ in $A$ such that $a f=0$. [Choose a polynomial $g=b_{0}+b_{1} x+\cdots+b_{m} x^{m}$ of least degree $m$ such that $f g=0$. Then $a_{n} b_{m}=0$, hence $a_{n} g=0$ (because $a_{n} g$ annihilates $f$ and has degree $<m)$. Now show by induction that $a_{n \rightarrow r} g=0(0 \leqslant r \leqslant n)$.]

iv) $f$ is said to be primitive if $\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)=$ (1). Prove that if $f, g \in A[x]$, then $f g$ is primitive $\Leftrightarrow f$ and $g$ are primitive.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{12}
  \item Let $K$ be a field and let $\Sigma$ be the set of all irreducible monic polynomials $f$ in one indeterminate with coefficients in $K$. Let $A$ be the polynomial ring over $K$ generated by indeterminates $x_{f}$, one for each $f \in \Sigma$. Let $a$ be the ideal of $A$ generated by the polynomials $f\left(x_{f}\right)$ for all $f \in \Sigma$. Show that $a \neq(1)$.
\end{enumerate}

Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of $A$ containing $\mathfrak{a}$, and let $K_{1}=A / \mathfrak{m}$. Then $K_{1}$ is an extension field of $K$ in which each $f \in \Sigma$ has a root. Repeat the construction with $K_{1}$ in place of $K$, obtaining a field $K_{2}$, and so on. Let $L=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} K_{n}$. Then $L$ is a field in which each $f \in \Sigma$ splits completely into linear factors. Let $R$ be the set of all elements of $L$ which are algebraic over $K$. Then $\bar{K}$ is an algebraic closure of $K$.

  \item In a ring $A$, let $\Sigma$ be the set of all ideals in which every element is a zero-divisor. Show that the set $\Sigma$ has maximal elements and that every maximal element of $\Sigma$ is a prime ideal. Hence the set of zero-divisors in $A$ is a union of prime ideals.
\end{enumerate}

The prime spectrum of a ring

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{14}
  \item Let $A$ be a ring and let $X$ be the set of all prime ideals of $A$. For each subset $E$ of $A$, let $V(E)$ denote the set of all prime ideals of $A$ which contain $E$. Prove that
\end{enumerate}

i) if $\mathfrak{a}$ is the ideal generated by $E$, then $V(E)=V(\mathfrak{a})=V(r(\mathfrak{a}))$.

ii) $V(0)=X, V(1)=\varnothing$.

iii) if $\left(E_{i}\right)_{i \in I}$ is any family of subsets of $A$, then

\[
V\left(\bigcup_{i \in I} E_{i}\right)=\bigcap_{t \in l} V\left(E_{t}\right) .
\]

iv) $V(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})=V(\mathfrak{a} b)=V(\mathfrak{a}) \cup V(\mathfrak{b})$ for any ideals $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}$ of $A$.

These results show that the sets $V(E)$ satisfy the axioms for closed sets in a topological space. The resulting topology is called the Zariski topology. The topological space $X$ is called the prime spectrum of $A$, and is written $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{15}
  \item Draw pictures of Spec (Z), Spec (R), Spec (C[x]), Spec (R $[x])$, Spec $(Z[x])$.

  \item For each $f \in A$, let $X_{f}$ denote the complement of $V(f)$ in $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$. The sets $X_{f}$ are open. Show that they form a basis of open sets for the Zariski topology, and that

\end{enumerate}

i) $X_{f} \cap X_{g}=X_{f g}$;

ii) $X_{f}=\varnothing \Leftrightarrow f$ is nilpotent;

iii) $X_{f}=X \Leftrightarrow f$ is a unit;

iv) $X_{f}=X_{g} \Leftrightarrow r((f))=r((g))$;

v) $X$ is quasi-compact (that is, every open covering of $X$ has a finite subcovering).

vi) More generally, each $X_{f}$ is quasi-compact.

vii) An open subset of $X$ is quasi-compact if and only if it is a finite union of sets $X_{f}$.

The sets $X_{f}$ are called basic open sets of $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$.

[To prove (v), remark that it is enough to consider a covering of $X$ by basic open sets $X_{f_{i}}(i \in I)$. Show that the $f_{i}$ generate the unit ideal and hence that there is an equation of the form

\[
1=\sum_{i \in J} g_{i} f_{i} \quad\left(g_{i} \in A\right)
\]

where $J$ is some finite subset of $I$. Then the $X_{f_{i}}(i \in J)$ cover $X$.] 18. For psychological reasons it is sometimes convenient to denote a prime ideal of $A$ by a letter such as $x$ or $y$ when thinking of it as a point of $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$. When thinking of $x$ as a prime ideal of $A$, we denote it by $\mathfrak{p}_{x}$ (logically, of course, it is the same thing). Show that

i) the set $\{x\}$ is closed (we say that $x$ is a "closed point") in $\operatorname{Spec}(A) \Leftrightarrow \mathfrak{p}_{x}$ is maximal;

ii) $\overline{\{x\}}=V\left(\mathfrak{p}_{x}\right)$;

iii) $y \in \overline{\{x\}} \Leftrightarrow \mathfrak{p}_{x} \subseteq \mathfrak{p}_{y}$;

iv) $X$ is a $T_{0}$-space (this means that if $x, y$ are distinct points of $X$, then either there is a neighborhood of $x$ which does not contain $y$, or else there is a neighborhood of $y$ which does not contain $x$ ).

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{18}
  \item A topological space $X$ is said to be irreducible if $X \neq \varnothing$ and if every pair of non-empty open sets in $X$ intersect, or equivalently if every non-empty open set is dense in $X$. Show that $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is irreducible if and only if the nilradical of $A$ is a prime ideal.

  \item Let $X$ be a topological space.

\end{enumerate}

i) If $Y$ is an irreducible (Exercise 19) subspace of $X$, then the closure $\bar{Y}$ of $Y$ in $X$ is irreducible.

ii) Every irreducible subspace of $X$ is contained in a maximal irreducible subspace.

iii) The maximal irreducible subspaces of $X$ are closed and cover $X$. They are called the irreducible components of $X$. What are the irreducible components of a Hausdorff space?

iv) If $A$ is a ring and $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$, then the irreducible components of $X$ are the closed sets $V(\mathfrak{p})$, where $\mathfrak{p}$ is a minimal prime ideal of $A$ (Exercise 8).

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{20}
  \item Let $\phi: A \rightarrow B$ be a ring homomorphism. Let $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ and $Y=\operatorname{Spec}(B)$. If $\hat{q} \in Y$, then $\phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})$ is a prime ideal of $A$, i.e., a point of $X$. Hence $\phi$ induces a mapping $\phi^{*}: Y \rightarrow X$. Show that
\end{enumerate}

i) If $f \in A$ then $\phi^{*-1}\left(X_{f}\right)=Y_{\phi(f)}$, and hence that $\phi^{*}$ is continuous.

ii) If $\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal of $A$, then $\phi^{*-1}(V(\mathfrak{a}))=V\left(\mathfrak{a}^{e}\right)$.

iii) If $\mathfrak{b}$ is an ideal of $B$, then $\overline{\phi^{*}(V(\mathfrak{b}))}=V\left(\mathfrak{b}^{c}\right)$.

iv) If $\phi$ is surjective, then $\phi^{*}$ is a homeomorphism of $Y$ onto the closed subset $V(\operatorname{Ker}(\phi))$ of $X$. (In particular, $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ and $\operatorname{Spec}(A / \mathfrak{R})$ (where $\mathfrak{R}$ is the nilradical of $A$ ) are naturally homeomorphic.)

v) If $\phi$ is injective, then $\phi^{*}(Y)$ is dense in $X$. More precisely, $\phi^{*}(Y)$ is dense in $X \Leftrightarrow \operatorname{Ker}(\phi) \subseteq \Re$.

vi) Let $\psi: B \rightarrow C$ be another ring homomorphism. Then $(\psi \circ \phi)^{*}=\phi^{*} \circ \psi^{*}$.

vii) Let $A$ be an integral domain with just one non-zero prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$, and let $K$ be the field of fractions of $A$. Let $B=(A / \mathfrak{p}) \times K$. Define $\phi: A \rightarrow B$ by $\phi(x)=(\bar{x}, x)$, where $\bar{x}$ is the image of $x$ in $A / \mathfrak{p}$. Show that $\phi^{*}$ is bijective but not a homeomorphism.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{21}
  \item Let $A=\prod_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}$ be the direct product of rings $A_{i}$. Show that $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is the disjoint union of open (and closed) subspaces $X_{i}$, where $X_{i}$ is canonically homeomorphic with $\operatorname{Spec}\left(A_{i}\right)$. Conversely, let $A$ be any ring. Show that the following statements are equivalent:
\end{enumerate}

i) $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is disconnected.

ii) $A \cong A_{1} \times A_{2}$ where neither of the rings $A_{1}, A_{2}$ is the zero ring.

iii) $A$ contains an idempotent $\neq 0,1$.

In particular, the spectrum of a local ring is always connected (Exercise 12).

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{22}
  \item Let $A$ be a Boolean ring (Exercise 11), and let $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$.
\end{enumerate}

i) For each $f \in A$, the set $X_{f}$ (Exercise 17) is both open and closed in $X$.

ii) Let $f_{1}, \ldots, f_{n} \in A$. Show that $X_{f_{1}} \cup \ldots \cup X_{f_{n}}=X_{f}$ for some $f \in A$.

iii) The sets $X$, are the only subsets of $X$ which are both open and closed. [Let $Y \subseteq X$ be both open and closed. Since $Y$ is open, it is a union of basic open sets $X_{f}$. Since $Y$ is closed and $X$ is quasi-compact (Exercise 17), $Y$ is quasi-compact. Hence $Y$ is a finite union of basic open sets; now use (ii) above.]

iv) $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{23}
  \item Let $L$ be a lattice, in which the sup and inf of two elements $a, b$ are denoted by $a \vee b$ and $a \wedge b$ respectively. $L$ is a Boolean lattice (or Boolean algebra) if
\end{enumerate}

i) $L$ has a least element and a greatest element (denoted by 0,1 respectively).

ii) Each of $\vee, \wedge$ is distributive over the other.

iii) Each $a \in L$ has a unique "complement" $a^{\prime} \in L$ such that $a \vee a^{\prime}=1$ and $a \wedge a^{\prime}=0$.

(For example, the set of all subsets of a set, ordered by inclusion, is a Boolean lattice.)

Let $L$ be a Boolean lattice. Define addition and multiplication in $L$ by the rules

\[
a+b=\left(a \wedge b^{\prime}\right) \vee\left(a^{\prime} \wedge b\right), \quad a b=a \wedge b .
\]

Verify that in this way $L$ becomes a Boolean ring, say $A(L)$.

Conversely, starting from a Boolean ring $A$, define an ordering on $A$ as follows: $a \leqslant b$ means that $a=a b$. Show that, with respect to this ordering, $A$ is a Boolean lattice. [The sup and inf are given by $a \vee b=a+b+a b$ and $a \wedge b=a b$, and the complement by $a^{\prime}=1-a$.] In this way we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between (isomorphism classes of) Boolean rings and (isomorphism classes of) Boolean lattices.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{24}
  \item From the last two exercises deduce Stone's theorem, that every Boolean lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of open-and-closed subsets of some compact Hausdorff topological space.

  \item Let $A$ be a ring. The subspace of $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ consisting of the maximal ideals of $A$, with the induced topology, is called the maximal spectrum of $A$ and is denoted by $\operatorname{Max}(A)$. For arbitrary commutative rings it does not have the nice functorial properties of Spec $(A)$ (see Exercise 21), because the inverse image of a maximal ideal under a ring homomorphism need not be maximal.

\end{enumerate}

Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and let $C(X)$ denote the ring of all real-valued continuous functions on $X$ (add and multiply functions by adding and multiplying their values). For each $x \in X$, let $\mathfrak{m}_{x}$ be the set of all $f \in C(X)$ such that $f(x)=0$. The ideal $\mathfrak{m}_{x}$ is maximal, because it is the kernel of the (surjective) homomorphism $C(X) \rightarrow \mathrm{R}$ which takes $f$ to $f(x)$. If $\bar{X}$ denotes $\operatorname{Max}(C(X))$, we have therefore defined a mapping $\mu: X \rightarrow \bar{X}$, namely $x \rightarrow \mathfrak{m}_{x}$. We shall show that $\mu$ is a homeomorphism of $X$ onto $\tilde{X}$.

i) Let $m$ be any maximal ideal of $C(X)$, and let $V=V(m)$ be the set of common zeros of the functions in $m$ : that is,

\[
V=\{x \in X: f(x)=0 \text { for all } f \in m\} .
\]

Suppose that $V$ is empty. Then for each $x \in X$ there exists $f_{x} \in \mathfrak{m}$ such that $f_{x}(x) \neq 0$. Since $f_{x}$ is continuous, there is an open neighborhood $U_{x}$ of $x$ in $X$ on which $f_{x}$ does not vanish. By compactness a finite number of the neighborhoods, say $U_{x_{1}}, \ldots, U_{x_{n}}$, cover $X$. Let

\[
f=f_{x_{1}}^{2}+\cdots+f_{x_{n}}^{2} \text {. }
\]

Then $f$ does not vanish at any point of $X$, hence is a unit in $C(X)$. But this contradicts $f \in \mathfrak{m}$, hence $V$ is not empty.

Let $x$ be a point of $V$. Then $\mathfrak{m} \subseteq \mathfrak{m}_{x}$, hence $\mathfrak{m}=\mathfrak{m}_{x}$ because $\mathfrak{m}$ is maximal. Hence $\mu$ is surjective.

ii) By Urysohn's lemma (this is the only non-trivial fact required in the argument) the continuous functions separate the points of $X$. Hence $x \neq y \Rightarrow$ $\mathfrak{m}_{x} \neq \mathfrak{m}_{y}$, and therefore $\mu$ is injective.

iii) Let $f \in \bar{C}(\bar{X})$; let

\[
U_{f}=\{x \in X: f(x) \neq 0\}
\]

and let

\[
\tilde{U}_{f}=\{\mathfrak{m} \in \tilde{X}: f \notin \mathfrak{m}\}
\]

Show that $\mu\left(U_{f}\right)=\tilde{U}_{f}$. The open sets $U_{f}$ (resp. $\tilde{U}_{f}$ ) form a basis of the top= ology of $X$ (resp. $\tilde{X}$ ) and therefore $\mu$ is a homeomorphism.

Thus $X$ can be reconstructed from the ring of functions $C(X)$.

be a set of polynomial equations in $n$ variables with coefficients in $k$. The set $X$ of all points $x=\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right) \in k^{n}$ which satisfy these equations is an affine algebraic variety.

Consider the set of all polynomials $g \in k\left[t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n}\right]$ with the property that $g(x)=0$ for all $x \in X$. This set is an ideal $I(X)$ in the polynomial ring, and is called the ideal of the variety $X$. The quotient ring

\[
P(X)=k\left[t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n}\right] / I(X)
\]

is the ring of polynomial functions on $X$, because two polynomials $g, h$ define the same polynomial function on $X$ if and only if $g-h$ vanishes at every point of $X$, that is, if and only if $g-h \in I(X)$. Let $\xi_{l}$ be the image of $t_{i}$ in $P(X)$. The $\xi_{t}(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n)$ are the coordinate functions on $X:$ if $x \in X$, then $\xi_{i}(x)$ is the $i$ th coordinate of $x . P(X)$ is generated as a $k$-algebra by the coordinate functions, and is called the coordinate ring (or affine algebra) of $X$.

As in Exercise 26, for each $x \in X$ let $\mathrm{m}_{x}$ be the ideal of all $f \in P(X)$ such that $f(x)=0$; it is a maximal ideal of $P(X)$. Hence, if $\tilde{X}=\operatorname{Max}(P(X))$, we have defined a mapping $\mu: X \rightarrow \bar{X}$, namely $x \mapsto \mathfrak{m}_{x}$.

It is easy to show that $\mu$ is injective: if $x \neq y$, we must have $x_{t} \neq y_{t}$ for for some $i(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n)$, and hence $\xi_{i}-x_{i}$ is in $\mathfrak{m}_{x}$ but not in $\mathfrak{m}_{y}$, so that $\mathfrak{m}_{x} \neq \mathfrak{m}_{y}$. What is less obvious (but still true) is that $\mu$ is surjective. This is one form of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (see Chapter 7).

  \item Let $f_{1}, \ldots, f_{m}$ be elements of $k\left[t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n}\right]$. They determine a polynomial mapping $\phi: k^{n} \rightarrow k^{m}:$ if $x \in k^{n}$, the coordinates of $\phi(x)$ are $f_{1}(x), \ldots, f_{m}(x)$.
\end{enumerate}

Let $X, Y$ be affine algebraic varieties in $k^{n}, k^{m}$ respectively. A mapping $\phi: X \rightarrow Y$ is said to be regular if $\phi$ is the restriction to $X$ of a polynomial mapping from $k^{n}$ to $k^{m}$.

If $\eta$ is a polynomial function on $Y$, then $\eta \circ \phi$ is a polynomial function on $X$. Hence $\phi$ induces a $k$-algebra homomorphism $P(Y) \rightarrow P(X)$, namely $\eta \mapsto \eta \circ \phi$. Show that in this way we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between the regular mappings $X \rightarrow Y$ and the $k$-algebra homomorphisms $P(Y) \rightarrow P(X)$.
